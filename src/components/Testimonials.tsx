                      Been going there the past 5 years since I started growing
                      back my hair. Eliâ€™s is a family friendly place where all
                      are welcome. Just remember to give them a little extra if
                      you are able too. Enjoy your time there. Be calm and be
                      patient. Thank you

                      Took my young daughter in for a deep condition and blow
                      dry. The stylist was awesome and my daughter's hair was
                      amazing. The only hiccup for me was that the washing
                      chairs were not comfortable for a little person. Her head
                      slipped right through the opening and she wasn't supported
                      enough.
